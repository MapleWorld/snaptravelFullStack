There are some problem with accessing the link "https://experimentation.getsnaptravel.com/interview/hotels" that is mentioned in the Fullstack Demo github link.

Need a valid account in order to send POST request to "https://experimentation.getsnaptravel.com/interview/hotels"

Wrote an independent Server to mock the behavior, however, due to limited time constraints, I can only mock partial contents and behaviors.

To start the client
Go into the Client folder, execute "npm install"
Then execute "npm start" to start the UI
Navigate to localhost:8080 to view

To start the server
Go into the Server folder, execute "npm install"
Then execute "npm start" to start the server
Send request to localhost:3000 for processing
